# ProtocolPlayground

This is a playground for my 2018 talk at [dotSwift](https://www.dotconferences.com/conference/dotswift-2018), Protocols All The Way Down. 

There are two pages: One with examples of the stuff I did with protocols with default implementation, and another with an example of the pitfalls. You can access both pages by either going to **Editor -> Show Rendered Markup** and using the links contained within the rendered markup, or by opening the left navigator pane to see all the files contained within the project.
